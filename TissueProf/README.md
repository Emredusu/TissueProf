This plugin is used to analyze the co-expression of multiple genes/proteins/molecules of interest in 
cells that are found in one or more zones of the target tissue. It takes as input a multi-channel
confocal image and outputs a Results file in excel format as well as various ROI sets 
and images that are saved during analysis for tracing the data and later review.
